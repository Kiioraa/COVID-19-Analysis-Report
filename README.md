# Data Sourcing
- #### Data was scraped from the web into Excel so as to have a real time update.
- #### I retrieved the csse_covid_19_time_series tables from the CSSEGISandData/COVID19 repository on GitHub, which provides comprehensive data on global confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths related to COVID-19.

# Data Transformation and Cleaning
- The data was tidied and refined using the Power Query Editor to ensure its reliability and improve its quality.
  
- The three time series tables were merged/combined to create a unified and consolidated table.

- Tables were named accordingly.

- The colums were adjusted by upivoting some columns.

- New columns were added to separate the **Year, Month and Day**.

- Pivot tables were created for analysis purpose.

- Lastly, a dashboard was created.
